# DoNotOverwater

---

> This is a StardewValley mod that only lets you water unwatered crops

## Why?

Especially when starting a new farm I hate accidentally watering tiles that are not even crops or crops I've already watered. So I spent an hour to save those precious seconds. 

This mod prevents you from watering anything that is not an unwatered crop. 

## Instructions to build:

1. I used rider so install that
2. install the dotnet 6 SDK (using the instructions below)
3. clone this repo 
4. open it in rider
5. build whole solution
6. have fun with StardewValley

## Install the dotnet 6 SDK for Debian

1. download the installer script
`wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`
2. make it executable `chmod +x dotnet-install.sh`
3. run it using the channel 6.0 `./dotnet-install.sh --channel 6.0`
